# Re-stream the `handling.meta` for all base game vehicles (FiveM)

This is a drag-and-drop resource that will restream the `handling.meta` for all base game vehicles.

All vehicles are entirely stock and taken from the base game (thanks OpenIV ❤️), except that I've added `<strAdvancedFlags>` so that we can control cool new game features in real-time (such as differentials, manual transmissions and more).

Contains all vehicles up to **3407** (mp2024_02/Agents of Sabotage).

## Installation

1. Drag the resource into your `resources` folder
2. Add `ensure fivem-base-vehicle-handling` to your `server.cfg`
3. Restart your server
